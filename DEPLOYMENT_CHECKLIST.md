## ‚úÖ Full Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Local build passes
  ```bash
  npm run build
  # Should complete without errors
  ```

- [ ] No API keys in source code
  ```bash
  grep -r "AIzaSyC" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
  # Should return NO results (empty)
  
  grep -r "974.*9442b9" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
  # Should return NO results (empty)
  ```

- [ ] .env.local in .gitignore
  ```bash
  grep "env.local" .gitignore
  # Should show: .env.local
  ```

- [ ] All changes committed
  ```bash
  git status
  # Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
  ```

### Vercel Configuration

- [ ] Repository connected to Vercel
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY set in all environments
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CX set in all environments
- [ ] vercel.json present in root directory
- [ ] .gitignore blocks sensitive files

### Deployment Execution

- [ ] Initial build succeeds
  - Check build logs: No errors
  - Check build logs: "‚úÖ Environment variables validated successfully"

- [ ] Production deployment goes live
  - Visit deployed URL
  - Should load without errors

### Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Home page loads
  ```
  Visit: https://[your-project].vercel.app
  Expected: SeekEngine homepage with search bar
  ```

- [ ] Search functionality works
  ```
  1. Enter "hello"
  2. Click search
  3. Expected: Results page loads
  ```

- [ ] No console errors
  ```

  1. Try searching without text
  2. Expected: Error message "Please enter a search term"
  ```

- [ ] Rate limiting works
  ```

  2. After 50: Should see 429 error
  3. Expected: Rate limiting is active
  ```

---

## üîê Security Verification

After deployment, verify security measures:

### 1. API Keys Protected
```bash
# Visit deployed site and check source
# Search for "AIzaSyC" or your API key
# Should NOT appear anywhere

Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí search.js
Look at request to /api/search
Should see: ?term=xxx&start=1&type=all
Should NOT see: any API key
```

### 2. Environment Variables Working
```
Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
Should see: No errors about missing environment variables
Should see: Search works normally
```

### 3. Input Validation Active
```
Try searching with special characters: <script>alert('xss')</script>
Should see: Sanitized search or error message
Should NOT see: Script execution
```

### 4. Rate Limiting Active
```
Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
Make 55 rapid search requests
After 50: Should see 429 error
Check rate limit headers: RateLimit-Remaining
```

---

## üìä Monitoring Post-Deployment

### Daily (Week 1)
- [ ] Check Vercel Deployments for any failed builds
- [ ] Check Vercel Monitoring for error logs
- [ ] Test search functionality manually
- [ ] Monitor API quota usage

### Weekly
- [ ] Review error rates in Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Check Web Vitals performance metrics
- [ ] Review rate limiting statistics
- [ ] Verify no security issues

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies: `npm update`
- [ ] Rotate API keys if needed
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Plan next improvements

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: "Cannot find module 'express-rate-limit'"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` locally, commit package-lock.json, redeploy

### Search Returns 400 Error
**Solution**: Check browser console, verify search term is valid

### "Environment variables validated successfully" but search doesn't work
**Solution**: 
1. Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY in Vercel settings
2. Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CX in Vercel settings
3. Both must be set in ALL environments
4. Redeploy after setting

### Rate Limiter Errors in Build
**Solution**: Clear .next cache, redeploy
```bash
rm -rf .next
git push origin main  # Trigger new deployment
```
