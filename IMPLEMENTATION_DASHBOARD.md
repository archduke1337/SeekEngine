## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### Issue 1: Exposed API Keys
```
Status:    🔴 CRITICAL
Location:  keys.js
Risk:      Anyone can abuse your Google API quota
Fix Time:  15 minutes
Solution:  Move to .env.local + .gitignore
Impact:    Prevents $$ waste & security breach
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `.env.local` with credentials
- [ ] Update `keys.js` to use `process.env`
- [ ] Update `.gitignore`
- [ ] Delete from git history (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Rotate Google API keys

---

### Issue 2: No Input Validation
```
Status:    🔴 SECURITY RISK
Location:  pages/api/search.js, pages/index.js
Risk:      SQL injection, XSS attacks
Fix Time:  30 minutes
Solution:  Add validation utility + sanitization
Impact:    Protects database and users
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `utils/validation.js`
- [ ] Update API routes
- [ ] Update search handlers

---

### Issue 3: No Rate Limiting
```
Status:    🔴 ABUSE RISK
Location:  pages/api/search.js
Risk:      API quota exhaustion, DDoS
Fix Time:  45 minutes
Solution:  Add express-rate-limit middleware
Impact:    Protects API & infrastructure
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Install `express-rate-limit`
- [ ] Create rate limiter middleware
- [ ] Apply to search endpoint

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY (Very Important)

### Issue 4: No TypeScript
```
Status:    🟠 TECHNICAL DEBT
Location:  All files
Risk:      Bugs in production, hard to refactor
Fix Time:  2-3 hours
Impact:    Catches 40% of bugs before runtime
Priority:  After critical issues
```

**Benefit:**
- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Better IDE autocomplete
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

---

### Issue 5: No Tests
```
Status:    🟠 QUALITY RISK
Location:  N/A (missing entirely)
Risk:      Regressions in production
Fix Time:  4-6 hours (initial setup)
Impact:    Confidence in code changes
Priority:  After critical issues
```

**Testing Coverage Needed:**
- Unit tests (hooks, utilities)
- Component tests (SearchInput, Results)
- Integration tests (search flow)
- E2E tests (user workflows)

---

### Issue 6: No Linting/Formatting
```
Status:    🟠 CODE QUALITY
Location:  All files
Risk:      Inconsistent code style
Fix Time:  1 hour
Impact:    Team productivity, maintainability
Priority:  After critical issues
```

**Setup:**
- [ ] Install ESLint + Prettier
- [ ] Configure rules
- [ ] Add to CI/CD

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

```
Effort:    45 minutes
Impact:    Better UX, repeat searches easier
Priority:  Medium
```

### Feature: Advanced Filters
```
Effort:    2 hours
Impact:    More powerful searches
Priority:  Medium
```

### Performance: Service Worker
```
Effort:    1-2 hours
Impact:    Offline support, faster loads
Priority:  Medium
```
