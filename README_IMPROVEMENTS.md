## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

Your codebase has **3 critical security issues** that need immediate fixing:

### 🔴 Issue #1: Exposed API Keys
```
Location: keys.js
Risk: Anyone can abuse your Google API quota
Cost: Potentially thousands of dollars
Fix Time: 15 minutes
Solution: Move to .env.local
```

### 🔴 Issue #2: No Input Validation  
```
Location: Search endpoints
Risk: SQL injection & XSS attacks
Cost: Data breach risk
Fix Time: 30 minutes
Solution: Add validation utility
```

### 🔴 Issue #3: No Rate Limiting
```
Location: /api/search endpoint
Risk: API quota exhaustion
Cost: Service downtime
