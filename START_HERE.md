## 🔴 Critical Issues (Do First)

All in these documents, but here's the TL;DR:

### 1. Exposed API Keys 🚨
- **Where**: `keys.js`
- **Problem**: Anyone can see and abuse your Google API credentials
- **Fix**: Move to `.env.local` → 15 minutes
- **Doc**: QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Section 1)

### 2. No Input Validation 🔓
- **Where**: Search endpoints
- **Problem**: Could allow injection attacks
- **Fix**: Add validation utility → 30 minutes
- **Doc**: QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Section 2)

### 3. No Rate Limiting 📈
- **Where**: API routes
- **Problem**: Users can abuse API quota
- **Fix**: Add rate limiter → 45 minutes
- **Doc**: QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Section 3)

**Time to fix all critical issues**: ~2 hours
**ROI**: Priceless (prevents security breach + financial loss)
