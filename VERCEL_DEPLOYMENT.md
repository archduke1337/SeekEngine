# Vercel Deployment Guide for SeekEngine

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Before deploying, ensure your git repository is clean and ready:

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# You should see:
# - .env.local (not tracked - good!)
# - All source files tracked

# If .env.local is tracked, remove it:
git rm --cached .env.local
git commit -m "Remove environment file from tracking"
```

**Verify .gitignore includes .env.local:**
```bash
grep -i "env.local" .gitignore
# Should output: .env.local
```

---

### Step 2: Connect Repository to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub (or create account)
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your SeekEngine repository
5. Click "Import"

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

This is **CRITICAL** - your API keys go here, not in code:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables:

#### Variable 1: Google API Key
- **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- **Value**: Your actual Google Custom Search API key
- **Environments**: Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"

#### Variable 2: Custom Search Engine ID
- **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CX`
- **Value**: Your actual Custom Search Engine ID
- **Environments**: Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**:
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (required for browser access)
- Add to ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development)
- Never paste keys in chat or email
- Store keys securely

---

### Step 4: Deploy

After setting environment variables:

1. Go back to project overview
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Vercel will automatically:
   - Clone your repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your project
   - Deploy to production

**Expected output:**
```
‚úì Built successfully
‚úì Environment variables validated successfully
‚úì Deployed to production
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.local` is NOT committed to git
- [ ] No API keys in source code
- [ ] All files committed to git
- [ ] Build passes locally: `npm run build`

### During Deployment:
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] Build succeeds in Vercel
- [ ] No build errors or warnings

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Visit deployed URL
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Monitor error logs

---

## üîí Security Best Practices for Vercel

### 1. Environment Variable Protection
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-accessible vars
- Keep secrets in Vercel dashboard
- Never commit .env files
- Rotate keys regularly

‚ùå DON'T:
- Hardcode API keys in code
- Share .env files
- Log sensitive variables
- Use old/exposed keys
```

### 2. Rate Limiting on Vercel
The rate limiter works on Vercel because:
- Express middleware runs in serverless functions
- IP addresses are properly forwarded via X-Forwarded-For
- Each deployment gets fresh rate limit counters

**Note**: If you scale to multiple regions, consider Redis for distributed rate limiting (optional, not needed initially)

### 3. Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
- Error logs in Vercel dashboard
- Rate limiting 429 responses
- Invalid search attempts
- Environment validation logs

---

## üìä Deployment Configuration

### vercel.json (Optional - we'll create this)

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY": "@next_public_google_api_key",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CX": "@next_public_google_cx"
  },
  "functions": {
    "pages/api/**": {
      "maxDuration": 10,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting Deployment

### Issue: "Environment variables validated successfully" then 500 error

**Cause**: Missing environment variables in Vercel

**Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Verify both variables are set
3. Redeploy project

### Issue: Search returns 400 error

**Cause**: Validation failing on deployment

**Fix**:
1. Check browser console for error message
2. Verify search term is valid (not too long, no special chars)
3. Check API rate limit isn't exceeded

### Issue: Rate limiter showing "Too many requests" immediately

**Cause**: Rate limiter is working! Or IP detection issue

**Fix**:
- Wait 15 minutes for rate limit window to reset
- Different IP addresses have separate limits
- Check Vercel logs for rate limit hits

### Issue: Build fails with "NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY is not defined"

**Cause**: Environment variables not set in Vercel

**Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add both required variables
3. Click "Save"
4. Trigger new deployment (redeploy)

---

## üìà Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Check Logs in Vercel

1. Go to project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Select latest deployment
4. View logs (Stdout/Stderr)

**Look for**:
```
‚úÖ Environment variables validated successfully
‚úÖ Compiled successfully
‚úì Collecting page data
```

### Performance Metrics

Monitor in Vercel Analytics:
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Web Vitals

**Targets**:
- TTFB: < 500ms
- FCP: < 2.5s
- CLS: < 0.1

### Error Tracking

1. Check "Monitoring" tab in Vercel
2. Review error logs
3. Set up alerts (optional)

---

## üîÑ Redeployment Process

If you make code changes and want to redeploy:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Test locally
npm run build
npm run start

# 3. Commit to git
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Add XYZ improvement"
git push origin main

# 4. Vercel automatically deploys!
# No manual action needed
```

**Vercel automatically:**
- Pulls latest code
- Installs dependencies
- Builds project
- Deploys to production

---

## üåç Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Go to project settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Enter your domain
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. Wait for DNS propagation (5-48 hours)

---

## üîê Rotating API Keys

If you need to rotate your Google API keys (recommended):

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create new API key
3. Delete old key
4. Update in Vercel:
   - Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   - Trigger redeploy

---

- No downtime during failed deployments

### 3. Environment-Specific Config
- Production, Preview, and Development can have different settings
- Useful for A/B testing new features

### 4. Analytics
- Vercel provides built-in Web Analytics
- Track visitor patterns
- Identify performance bottlenecks

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If API Keys are Compromised:

1. **Immediately**:
   - Revoke old keys in Google Cloud Console
   - Create new API key
   - Update in Vercel

2. **Update Vercel**:
   - Go to Environment Variables
   - Update NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   - Save and trigger redeploy
